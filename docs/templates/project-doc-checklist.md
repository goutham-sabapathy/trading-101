# Project Documentation Checklist

Create a folder under `docs/projects/<project-name>/` with:

- `README.md`: short project summary + links to all project docs
- `prd.md`: goals, scope, users, success metrics
- `architecture.md`: components, interfaces, non-functional requirements
- `data-model-and-pipeline.md`: data requirements, schemas, collection/curation
- `rulebook.md`: decision rules for entry/exit/adjustments/risk
- `implementation-roadmap.md`: phased plan with deliverables
- `diagrams.md`: architecture and process flow diagrams

Quality bar:
- no duplicated generic explanations (link to `docs/common` instead)
- explicit assumptions and open decisions
- measurable acceptance criteria
