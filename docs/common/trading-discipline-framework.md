# Trading Discipline Framework

## Purpose
This is a rule-based discipline framework for consistent execution.

## 1. Core Philosophy

### Systems Over Emotions

Trading performance comes from repeatable execution, not prediction.

> Your job is execution, not prediction.

## 2. Risk Unit (`R`)

### Definition

`R` is the predefined amount you are willing to lose on one trade.

### Example

- Account size: `$10,000`
- Risk per trade: `1%`
- `1R = $100`

Outcomes:

- Loss: `-1R`
- Gain `$200`: `+2R`
- Gain `$50`: `+0.5R`

Track performance in `R-multiples`, not dollars.

## 3. What Qualifies as a Setup

A valid setup must include all of the following:

1. Defined market context
2. Clear entry trigger
3. Predefined stop loss
4. Predefined exit logic

If it is not objective and written, it is not a setup.

## 4. Target-Setting Methods

Never use random targets. Use one of the following:

1. `R-multiple targets`: fixed `2R` or `3R`
2. `Structure targets`: VWAP, prior-day high/low, major support/resistance
3. `Time exits`: fixed hold window, exit before lunch or end of day

## 5. Trade Frequency and Daily Guardrails

Beginner baseline:

- `1-3` trades per day maximum

System guardrails:

- Max daily loss: `1R-2R`
- Stop trading immediately when daily loss limit is hit

More trades usually increase emotional degradation.

## 6. Discipline Rules

### Do

- Trade only predefined setups
- Risk fixed % per trade
- Journal every trade
- Review weekly
- Stop after max daily loss

### Do Not

- Move stops
- Add to losers
- Trade emotionally
- Change strategy mid-session
- Stare at P&L during the trade

## 7. Options-Specific Discipline

### 0DTE

- Trade only first `60-90` minutes
- Use smaller sizing
- Take profits faster
- Avoid chop conditions

### Swing Options (`2-10 DTE`)

- Use time-based exits
- Use wider stops than 0DTE
- Avoid earnings unless setup explicitly includes earnings risk
- Account for theta decay in hold-window planning

## 8. Emotional Control Routine

### Why Physical Training Helps

A consistent fitness routine can support trading discipline by improving:

- stress response
- impulse control
- sleep quality
- delayed gratification

### Daily Mental Routine (`10 minutes`)

Pre-market:

- Review setup rules
- Visualize clean execution
- Affirm: "My job is execution"

Post-market:

- Review journal
- Flag rule violations
- Log emotional triggers

## 9. No-Trade Conditions

Do not trade when any of the following applies:

- poor sleep
- high emotional stress
- max daily loss already reached
- two rule violations in the same session

## 10. Professional Mindset

- Losses are business cost
- Capital preservation is priority
- Boring execution is usually better execution
- Focus on surviving 100 trades, not one day

## 11. Long-Term Focus

- One setup at a time
- Fixed risk per trade
- Lower frequency, higher quality
- Weekly review cadence

Formula:

`Edge + Discipline + Position Sizing = Long-term profitability`
